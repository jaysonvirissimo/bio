# Exported poll results from Less Wrong
# Columns: user, pollid, response, date
# user is either a username or a number (if the 'voted anonymously' button was
# checked). Anonymous user numbers are shared between poll questions asked in a
# single comment, but not between comments.
# pollid is a site-wide unique identifier of the poll.
# response is the user's answer to the poll. For multiple-choice polls, this is
# the index of their choice, starting at zero. For scale polls, this is the
# distance of their choice from the left, starting at zero. For probability and
# numeric polls, this is a number.
